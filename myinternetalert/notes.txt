it pings every 10 (configurable) seconds to chs.myinternetalert.com.  if the pinger on the tag doesn't get a return packet, it tries again (3 more times) and if none of those get through (ICMP remember ...)  it tries a 10 ping flood.  If none of those succeed, it assumes internet is lost and restarts the register daemon.  the back office watches for pings and records in mysql table.

every second, that table has status every record (ip address which pinged) over 17 seconds old changed  from 1 to zero

there's another program which watches the monitor table (above) and compares with history file, records the new info if it's different.  this creates a sparse history table where the last entry is the current status



production server is ok with me.

ping -c 1 -W1 -n -s 0  myinternetalert.com  (size = 0 which results in a final packet of 8 bytes)
